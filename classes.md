# Classes

This document highlights all of my undergraduate and graduate classes and what I've learned in each of them. This will hopefully make my project reflection easier, as I go back and remember what I've done in my classes.

This is a list of all classes I have attended at MSU, listed by semester. Underneath each semester title is a summary of the semester, including notable developments and milestones. Underneath each class is a summary of what I learned, as well as any notable assignemnts, projects, or accomplishments to remember.

## Fall 2020

This was my first semester at MSU. Covid regulations were still being adjusted to by professors, so I was merged in around the perfect time I would say.

### CSE 1384: Intermediate Comp Prog

How to program in C++, including classes, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

Languages: C++

### ECE 1013: Intro to ECE Design I

Soldering, breadboard prototyping, arduino, careers.

This class was very foundational for me, as a year later I would go back to help teach it as an SI leader.

Languages: C++

### HON 4990: The Science of Creativity

Psychology research centering around creativity -- what is it, how does it work, how have we studied it?

This was a very fun small class where I learned primarily what academic research looks like, as I had never before been exposed to it.

The final project in this class was a custom robot with wheels that we were intended to solder the parts onto and construct. This was a semester or two before they brought back the Practicum requirement of this course.

Languages: PIC24 Assembly, C

### MA 2743: Calculus IV

Many-dimensional integrals and vector / matrix logic of integrals

Some use of mathematica

### MA 3253: Differential Equations

### IE 4613: Eng Statistics I

Basic statistics like mean, median, mode, distributions, and T-tests.

## Summer 2022

This semester I traveled to Oxford with the Honors College under Dr. Snyder.

### HON 3183: Honors Seminar - Humanities: The Inklings of Oxford

We discussed C.S. Lewis' works, reading all of the Chronicles of Narnia and his many other books. Some discussion of where he wrote and walked and studied made this a very interesting class to take while in Oxford.

### HON 4003:  Oxbridge Tutorial: Cognitive Neuroscience

I studied cognitive neuroscience under Dr. Anna Scarna. I learned about the brain, development, and consciousness.

## Fall 2022

This semester I began lots of things! I began my 4 semesters with SI covering Data Structures, and I began research with Dr. Cindy Bethel in the Social, Therapeutic, and Robotic Systems (STaRS) Lab.

### CH 1211: Chemistry I Lab

Basic chemical experiments including colored flames, identifying household chemicals, and titration.

### CSE 4990: Special Topics in CSE: Virtual and Extended Reality Development

Development of VR projects using Unity. This class was taken with one of my favorite professors, Dr. Adam Jones. I learned about VR design practices to reduce motion sickness and I was able to practice my creativity and explore the Unity development environment.

Languages: C#

### ECE 3434: Adv Electronic Circuits

More about transistors, inductors, and large-scale circuit design.

This class's final project was to design an audio amplifier following lab instructions. Mine was the first in the class to be fully functional!

### ECE 3443: Signals and Systems

Exploration of mathematical functions that define signals. Use of MATLAB to analyze signals. Discussion of Convolution and Transformation functions. Consideration of frequency.

Languages: MATLAB

### ECE 4833: Data Comm Networks

I learned about data communications protocols in this class including how some of them are defined. Major discussions of how packets are organized and how computers interface with one another.

## Spring 2023

### CSE 3724: Computer Organization

I took this class for fun. All of the concepts in this class were covered in prior classes that I took. I TA'd this class a year later, so it was a good idea!

Learned about boolean logic, circuit design, and how a computer works on a fundamental level.

Languages: Nand2Tetris (HDL, ASM, binary)

### ECE 4532: CPE Design I

The senior design class for my major. In this class we began our project and learned what process we should follow to complete its design and implementation. My team's project was entitled "Train and Go." We developed a VR experience that allowed motorized wheelchair users to practice maneuvering in their wheelchair in virtual spaces without the dangers of a physical space.

### GE 3513: Technical Writing

This class accompanied CPE Design I by telling us what and how to write for the project. This class focused on developing documentation for the project.

### HON 1173: The Quest II

Another majorly humanities based class where we read popular books that are less old than Quest I. We read books like Frankenstein, M. Butterfly, Beloved, and Souls of Black Folk.

### PSY 3713: Cognitive Psychology

This class got more specific about psychology, exploring how the brain works and how cognitive functions are theorized to cause the psychological effects we observe in General Psychology.

## Fall 2023

### CSE 4663: Human-Computer Interaction

This class taught me about how humans and computers interact, including how to consider things like physical analogies that most users will be able to intuitively understand. This would include trash cans for removing files, a desktop for holding work, etc.

This class also covered some basic UI design practices like sketching, prototyping, testing, and deployment.

I designed an interface with a group for this class, which was designed for interacting with the robot Therabot.

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Node)

### CSE 4683: Machine Learning and Soft Computing

This class taught me foundational things about machine learning and had me work with the language CLIPS. I learned that much of machine learning is designed around soft computing, how computers can use fuzzy logic to give multiple categorical labels to one item (e.g. in some contexts the same person may be called tall that would otherwise be called short).

Languages: CLIPS

### CSE 4733: Operating Systems I

This class taught me about fundamental concepts behind an operating system like the kernel, task scheduling, etc.

### ECE 4542: CPE Design II

The senior design class for my major. In this class we finished our project and presented it to the public. My team won the best design for fall of 2023.

### ECE 4724: Embedded Systems

This class gave me a technical deep-dive into the use of microprocessors in engineered computing solutions. I learned about conversions between analog and digital, calculations and considerations for which microprocessor specifications are required for a solution to work, and the programming of machine-level logic.

## Spring 2024

### ECE 4713: Computer Architecture

### HON 4093: Honors Thesis

This class was a self-led course which allowed me time in my schedule to work on my Honors Thesis.

### MA 4183: Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning

### PSY 4653: Cognitive Science

## Fall 2024

This was my first semester enrolled as a Master's Student. Thanks to the Thrive in Five program, I already had 9 hours of Master's level credit to apply towards my degree, so I was able to complete my Master's in just an additional year after my Bachelor's.

### CSE 7000: DIS on Statistical Analysis in Research

### CSE 8753: Wireless Networks
