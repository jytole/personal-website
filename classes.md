# Classes

This document highlights all of my undergraduate classes and what I've learned in each of them. This will hopefully make my project reflection easier, as I go back and remember what I've done in my classes.

This is a list of all classes I have attended at MSU, listed by semester. Underneath each semester title is a summary of the semester, including notable developments and milestones. Underneath each class is a description of what I learned.
