# Projects

This document contains a comprehensive list of all the projects I can recall working on. I am writing this on March 25, 2024, so we will see if I remember to update it periodically. I guess I can think of this as a CV or work journal.

Updated on May 8, 2025.

## International Paper

### Certificate Information Visualization

Created a dashboard to view digital certificate information including expiration dates. Added buttons to create, update, or delete individual certificates to increase convenience of certificate interaction. Utilized XMLHTTP requests to achieve functionality. Utilized the "DataTables" JavaScript library to add convenient features like selection, sorting, and searching.

### Integration Server Monitor

Updated an administrative interface to fit within the design of a modern web application.

## Social, Therapeutic, and Robotic Systems Lab

### AudioLDM2 Training and Finetuning Pipeline

I designed an API and interface to host and interact with the AudioLDM2 Machine Learning model. This was completed in pursuance of my Master's Degree in Computer Science.

### Website Re-theme

I took the old STaRS website and rethemed it to look a little more modern.

### Emotibot

Planned and executed by me and research partner Jade Thompson.

This project involved the complete design of a crochet robot that reacts to being touched and picked up by users. Emotibot emits light, makes sound, and has a heartbeat which reflects its current mood. One robot is happy when it is not being touched, and anxious when it is picked up. The other robot is sad when it is not being touched, and happy when it is picked up. I designed the internal circuitry of the robot, integration of sound through a bluetooth speaker, and communication between the robots and a hub, while Jade designed the aesthetic appearance of the crochet covering and code for the arduinos on-board the robot.

### Therabot Audio

I developed a system to generate audio for Therabot. This was completed as an Honors Thesis coinciding with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering.

This system takes input sounds and manipulates the pitch of portions to produce a new sound which users view as emotional.

#### Participatory Design Study

I designed a lab study with participants and opinion gathering. This study was an attempt to validate the audio generation system.

#### Honnors Thesis

I crafted an honors thesis using the Therabot Audio work I completed.

This thesis, documenting the audio generation system and participatory design study, is available at: 

## Center for Cyber Innovation (CCI)

### Mock Dentist's Office (first college project)

Designed a dentist's office in collaboration with a student from FAMU. Drew an in-depth floor plan, network map, and policy documents. These were used by CCI to generate CSET reports that could be used as mock input data for their report parsing tool.

### CFI Materials

I used a virtual machine to design study materials for a computer forensic exam. I simulated a timestamp manipulation attack, which might be used by an attacker to convince an investigator that files were manipulated (or not manipulated) on a date on which there was no crime. This might be useful if the attacker wanted to edit or read a file without being noticed: they could return the timestamp to its original time.

I also designed cryptographic puzzles for a cyber camp.

## Supplemental Instruction

Considering this as a project, I have contributed to the education of Data Structures Students for a total of 4 semesters.

## Personal

### Nand2Tetris Python

(in progress)

A Python implementation of the Nand2Tetris library, for use in Mississippi State's Computer Organization classes. This project was suggested by Devin Neal, the professor for Computer Organization.

## Classes

This is a list of the projects completed for classes throughout my time at MSU.

### VXR Dev: Fall 2022

Various projects with classmates, I will try to find the files. Files are available in my school onedrive.

- Challenge 0: tried to implement a pool table (maybe I go back to fix this)
  - Project on my own
- Challenge 1: Project 188: Liquid Gold
  - A scifi experience with the goal of finding water (by pressing a hidden button, a water fountain comes out of the floor)
- Challenge 2: Primarily Plastic
  - A dollhouse experience where you feel like you're in a dollhouse and can teleport around using the dollhouse-inside-the-dollhouse as a map
- Challenge 3: Game Show
  - We had the user knock over a microphone to start a quiz show, which consisted of answering sci-fi questions
  - Questions were answered by moving left or right to collide with the incoming answer block.
- Final Project: Multiplayer Laser Shooting Game

### Intro to ECE Design

#### Hydration Helper

A water dispenser to help users track their water intake

Utilizes an arduino uno, weight sensor, water pump, button, and screen.

When a user presses the button, water is dispensed and, according to the weight added to the cup, is subtracted from the user's goal total. Hydration Helper helps users stay hydrated by holding them accountable for their running total water consumption throughout a day.

### ECE Senior Design

#### Train and Go

We won the best project!

Train and Go is a VR system to help train new wheelchairs without the danger of running into obstacles. Train and Go requires sensors to ensure no obstacles are within range, and a mount for a VR controller. If the sensors and mount are attached to a wheelchair and the user is introduced to the VR environment while physically in an open space, the user will be able to safely practice moving through a virtual environment without fear of running into anything.

### Embedded Systems

#### Product Dissection: Lil' Gamer

I designed a website to showcase the teardown and dissection of the commercial product, "Lil' Gamer" from Fisher Price. This project required an analysis of the internal circuitry of the device, including the design of both a functional and circuit diagram.
