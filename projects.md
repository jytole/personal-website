# Projects

This document contains a comprehensive list of all the projects I can recall working on. I am writing this on March 25, 2024, so we will see if I remember to update it periodically. I guess I can think of this as a CV or work journal.

Updated on August 8, 2024.

## International Paper

### Certificate Information Visualization

Created a dashboard to view digital certificate information including expiration dates. Added buttons to create, update, or delete individual certificates to increase convenience of certificate interaction. Utilized XMLHTTP requests to achieve functionality. Utilized the "DataTables" JavaScript library to add convenient features like selection, sorting, and searching.

### Integration Server Monitor

Updated an administrative interface to fit within the design of a modern web application.

## Social, Therapeutic, and Robotic Systems Lab

### Website Re-theme

Took the old website and rethemed it to look a little more modern.

### Emotibot

Planned and executed by me and research partner Jade Thompson.

### Therabot Audio

Developed a system to generate audio for Therabot

#### Participatory Design Study

Designed a lab study with participants and opinion gathering. An attempt to validate the audio generation system.

#### Honnors Thesis

Crafted an honors thesis using the Therabot Audio work I completed.

## Center for Cyber Innovation (CCI)

### Mock Dentist's Office (first college project :p)

Designed a dentist's office in collaboration with a student from FAMU. Drew an in-depth floor plan, network map, and policy documents. These were used by CCI to generate CSET reports that could be used as mock input data for their report parsing tool.

### CFI Materials

Not sure if this is the right acronym but I used a virtual machine to design study materials for a computer forensic exam. I simulated a timestamp manipulation attack, which might be used by an attacker to convince an investigator that files were manipulated (or not manipulated) on a date on which there was no crime. This might be useful if the attacker wanted to edit or read a file without being noticed: they could return the timestamp to its original time.

I also designed cryptographic puzzles for a sort of cyber camp.

## Supplemental Instruction

Considering this as a project, I have contributed to the education of Data Structures Students for a total of 4 semesters.

## Personal

## Classes

This is a list of the projects completed for classes throughout my time at MSU.

### VXR Dev: Fall 2022

Various projects with classmates, I will try to find the files. Files are available in my school onedrive.

- Challenge 0: tried to implement a pool table (maybe I go back to fix this)
- Challenge 1: Project 188: Liquid Gold
  - A scifi experience with the goal of finding water (by pressing a hidden button, a water fountain comes out of the floor)
- Challenge 2: Primarily Plastic
  - A dollhouse experience where you feel like you're in a dollhouse and can teleport around using the dollhouse-inside-the-dollhouse as a map
- Challenge 3: Game Show
  - We had the user knock over a microphone to start a quiz show, which consisted of answering sci-fi questions
  - Questions were answered by moving left or right to collide with the incoming answer block.
- Final Project: Multiplayer Laser Shooting Game
